# Scooter Rental Web App
This project is a web app made to simulate the workings of an electric scooter rental shop. 
The app's main features are showing available scooters for renting and their subsequent rental.
The app consists of a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript front end, .NET back end, along with a .NET-backed code-first database.
